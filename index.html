            Tim Berners-Lee is a software engineer who invented the Internet (or the World Wide Web) in 1989 
            while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory. He is director of the World Wide Web 
            Consortium that he founded and a Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of 
            Oxford. In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 2004 he was knighted. <br> <br><br>
            In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer 
            Science (LCS)
             at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. It was made up of companies that wanted 
             to work 
             together to create Web standards and also improve the Web. It was quickly agreed that the 
             technology 
             should be free of royalties and patents. Berners-Lee has served as director of this W3C since 
             it was 
             founded. In 1995 Microsoft produced the first version of Internet Explorer and this commercial 
             browser 
             created enormous growth in websites and web users. The Web was first used for e-commerce in 1997
